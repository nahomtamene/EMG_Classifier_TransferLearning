# EMG Classifier with Transfer Learning

This repository explores **electromyography (EMG) signal classification** using **machine learning and transfer learning techniques**. The project focuses on recognizing muscle activity patterns from EMG data and improving model performance by leveraging knowledge learned from related tasks or datasets.

## Repository Contents

- **EMGProjectML.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and transfer learning experiments.

- **MLProjectReport.pdf**  
  Project report describing the methodology, experiments, results, and conclusions.

## Project Overview

Electromyography (EMG) signals capture the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. These signals are commonly used in applications such as gesture recognition, prosthetics control, rehabilitation, and human–computer interaction.

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify EMG signals and investigates how **transfer learning** can help models generalize better when training data is limited or when adapting to new subjects or conditions.

## Objectives

- Classify EMG signals corresponding to different gestures or muscle activities  
- Apply transfer learning to improve classification performance  
- Evaluate model generalization across different data settings  

## Notebook Description

The `EMGProjectML.ipynb` notebook includes:

1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Feature extraction and/or signal preparation  
3. Model architecture definition  
4. Model training and evaluation  
5. Transfer learning experiments  
6. Performance analysis and visualization  

## Requirements

To run the notebook, install the required Python packages:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow jupyter


Additional libraries may be required depending on the environment or model configuration used in the notebook.



## Future Work
Possible extensions of this project include: Testing additional EMG datasets, Exploring alternative deep learning architectures, Improving cross-subject transfer learning, Deploying the classifier for real-time EMG applications
